## Programming in R

R is a legit programming language, which means that it gives you all the tools you need to automate repetitive tasks.  There are three (or more) main ways to do this:

* the `tidyverse`
  *  you have already seen some of the power of grouping data frames, summarizing and mutating using `dplyr` verbs
* `for` loops
* the `lapply()` function


## `for()` loops

### 

`for` loops will be familiar if you have ever used any other programming languages.  The basic structure looks like this:

```{r results='hide'}
myVector <- 1:10
for(i in myVector){
  #do something with i
}
```

### More complicated

Here is a (slightly) more complicated example. 

```{r for, exercise=TRUE}
myVector <- 1:10
for(counter in myVector){
  result <- paste("counter ^ 2 = ", counter^2)
  print(result)
}
```

Explanation in English:

-  We loop over a vector `1:10`, and sequentially assign each value from 1 to 10 to a temporary variable we are calling `counter`. (Note: we can call this variable whatever we want.) 
-  Then, R does what is within the curly braces `{}` for each iteration of the loop. Note: the curly braces basically package together multiple lines of code, to be executed as a group for each iteration. 
-  In this case, it pastes together some text with the square of the value of `counter` and prints this all to the console. 

*Question*: After running the above code, what is the value of `counter`? What is the value of `myVector`? Has this value changed? Don't forget to click the "Run Code" button.

### getting stuff out of a loop

Our example above just prints results to the screen, but it doesn't actually save them to do anywhing useful with later. To get something more re-usable for later, lets create a results vector to store the results from our loop.

Then we can save the results each time in the appropriate slot of our results vector. 



```{r forsave, exercise=TRUE}
letters <- c("A","B","C")
doubled_letters <- vector(mode="character", length=3)
for(i in 1:length(letters)){
  doubled_letters[i] <- paste(letters[i], letters[i])
}

letters
doubled_letters
```


### Challenge

Write your own `for()` loop that loops through the vector `people` and uses the `paste()` function to print this message to the screen for each name: "How are you doing, \<insert name\>?".

Note: there are ways to do this without a `for()` loop, but I want you to practice writing a `for()` loop!

Note2: you can't see the results of the `paste()` function when its running in a for loop.  To print the results to the screen, you have to explicitly use the `print()` function to print the result of each iteration to the screen. 

```{r chall, exercise=TRUE}
people<-c("Andrew", "Silvia", "Larry")
```

```{r chall-solution}
people<-c("Andrew", "Silvia", "Larry")
for(name in people){
  print(paste("Hello how are you", name,"?"))
}
```

## `if` statements

###

`if` statements allow your code to make decisions (kind of). Put more accurately, `it` statements allows you to give your code a detailed list of instructions, with different instructions based on distinct situations. 

### An example 


![](images/botanist.jpg)

Imagine you are a botanist. You are an active researcher and you just completed a seed germination experiment where you coded outcomes after planting seeds:

-  0 indicates the seed did not germinate due to insect predation
-  1 indicates that it did not germinate but no insect predation occurred
-  2 indicates that the seed germinated. 

We can use the `if()` function combined with a `for()` loop to evaluate the outcome and provide context specific output. 

Below, we have a vector called `outcomes` which reflects our raw data. 

We loop through each outcome, test whether the value is equal to 2, indicating germination, and issue a congratulatory message if so.  In all other cases, we issue a bereavement message. 

---

```{r seed, exercise=TRUE}
outcomes <- c(0,1,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0)
for(trial in outcomes){
  if(trial == 2) print("Welcome to the world, plantling!")
  else print("RIP")
}
```



## `lapply()`

###

The function `lapply()` is like a `for` loop.  However, it is focused on applying a function to each element of a vector.  In a for loop, you write a bunch of lines of code inside the curly brackets `{}` which get done for each element of the vector you are looping over.  With `lapply()` you specify the name of a function which gets applied to each element of the vector you want to loop over. 

### arguments to `lapply()`

`lapply()` requires 2 arguments 

-  `X` which is a list or a vector to loop over
-  `FUN` which is the name of a function to apply to each element of `X`.  

Thus, `FUN` must be able to accept any element of `X` as an argument. 

For example, the code below applies the `nchar()` function to each element of the vector `x`.  As you might be able to guess, the `nchar()` function counts the number of characters in a text string. 

```{r nchar, exercise=TRUE}
things <- c("dog","cat", "cucumber")
lapply(X=things, FUN=nchar)
```



## Writing your own functions

### 

Writing custom functions is a great way to encapsulate code that you want to re-use. 



### Anatomy of a Function

Functions have:

*  a ***name***
*  0 or more ***arguments***
*  the ***body*** of the function (i.e., code that does something with the arguments)
*  a ***return value***

### custom function example 

```{r duck, exercise=TRUE}
isItADuck <- function(input){
  test <- input == "duck"
  return(test)
}
```

*  `isItADuck` = the name of the function
*  `input` = the only argument for this function
*   all the code between the curly brackets `{}` is the body of the function
*  we use `return()` to specify what gets returned when we call the function (in this case it will be `TRUE` or `FALSE`, because we are returning the result of a logical test)


Notice that we use the function called `function()` to define a new custom function. 


### Critical Points

1.  the names `input` and `test` do not exist outside the function (i.e. after running the above code, you will get the following error if you type `input` into the R interpreter)

```
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'input' not found
```


2.  Nothing happens when we create the function.  Stuff happens later when we ***call*** the function with specific arguments. 

### Asking a function to run

```{r ducktry, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
isItADuck(input="duck")
```

When we ask `isItADuck()` to run, it needs an argument called `input`. ***But remember, this value this doesn't exist outside the function.***

We solved this problem by providing `"duck"` as the value of `input`.

What happens if you try running our custom function without a value for the `input` argument?

### Positional matching

Alternatively, you can rely on *positional matching* and let R guess what your arguments mean based on the order they are defined in the function definition. 

Positional matching explains why the below code will work as well...notice I don't explictly tell the function what "moose" is, so it assumes that it is the first argument, which is called `input` for our function. 

```{r}
isItADuck("moose")
```

This is straigntforward when a function accepts a single argument, as it does here.  But it gets confusing AF when there are lots of arguments, so its always clearer to explitly label your arguments, like this:

```{r}
isItADuck(input="moose")
# exact same as above, but more explicit, with argument clearly labeled
```

### A new arrow in our quiver!

<img src="images/Rquiver.png" width="300px">

Now we have a new function! It takes an argument, determines whether or not it was a duck, and returns either `TRUE` or `FALSE`

Now we can re-use this function over and over and over and over.  

Note, when we start a new R session this function will no longer exist.  So, typically your analysis scripts will incude code which defines important functions. 


### `lapply()` duck challenge

Use `lapply()` to apply our new function `isItADuck()` to each element of the `animals` vector below. 

```{r lduck, exercise=TRUE}
# your answer here
animals <- c("cat", "dog", "duck", "chicken")
```

```{r lduck-solution}
animals <- c("cat", "dog", "duck", "chicken")
result <- lapply(animals, FUN=isItADuck)
result
```

### Functions summary

* A function has arguments, that can only be referenced within the function itself. 

* When you ask a function to run, you must provide values for required arguments. 

* The `=` symbol is for assigning arguments values

* Code within the body of the function gets run only when you ask it to

* A *single value* is returned from a function, but this can be a vector containing multiple elements, a list, etc. 

## Lists

###

The "l" in `lapply()` stands for "list", because that's what you get as a result. 

### lists can be heterogeneous

**lists can hold any type of data, not every element needs to be the same type, as is the case for atomic vectors.**

```{r}
myList <- list(firstOne=1, nextOne="too", lastOne=rnorm(10))
myList
```

### you can use double brackets `[[]]` OR single brackets `[]` to index a list

```{r}
myList[[3]]
myList[3]
```



### `[[]]` versus `[]`

For five bonus points, what is the difference?

### lists with named elements

Sometimes, lists have named elements, which can be accessed using the `$` syntax

```{r}
myList$nextOne
```

Where have you seen the `$` operator before?

What does this suggest about the relationship between list and dataframes?

### Lists are useful because of their flexibility. 

We can store complex results from each iteration, and then come back to these results later. 

```{r}
# note, to be used with lapply() our function
# must accept an argument
# even if we don't do anything with this argument.
summarizeRandom <- function(n){
  sample <- rnorm(n)
  mySummary <- summary(sample)
  return(mySummary)
}

sampleSizes <- 100:200
myResults <- lapply(sampleSizes, FUN=summarizeRandom)
myResults[1:3]
```

### lists challenge

Check out the list called `listX`, explore it by pulling out its named elements, and indexing it using the `[[]]` syntax and the `[]` syntax. 

```{r, listChallenge, exercise=TRUE}
# explore the list here
```

Questions to ponder: 

*  what is the length of the overall list (using the `length()` function)
*  what are the lengths of each element of `listX`...are they all the same length?
*  what types of data are stored in each list element
