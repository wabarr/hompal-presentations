## the `tidyverse`

###

`tidyverse` is a series of R packages that has revolutionized working with data in R. This week we will be using one of the packages in the `tidyverse` called `dplyr`, which provides a consistent and simple interface to do common data manipulation tasks.

Next week, we will focus on another of the `tidyverse` packages called `ggplot2` which is useful for making graphs and figures. 

### the dplyr package

`dplyr` is a package within the tidyverse for manipulating dataframes.  It is very consistent. 

`dplyr` assumes that you are starting with a dataframe, doing something to that dataframe, and finishing with a different dataframe. 

Many of the base R functions operate on atomic vectors, which makes it more complicated to apply them to dataframes.

`dplyr` introduces a series of simple 'verbs' that describe many common data manipulation tasks. 

## main dataset for tutorial

We will be using a dataset on student loans in public and private universities.  [DMV_2014_Q3_Undergrad_DirectLoans.txt](stats.are-awesome.com/datasets/DMV_2014_Q3_Undergrad_DirectLoans.txt)

We can read it in using `read.table()` and save it to a variable called `loans`. The same `read.table()` function can deal with local and remote data sources. You can modify this code in your own work to read data from remote sources (i.e. files from the internet), or to read data from your own computer.   

```{r readdata}
# notice how first we define a variable called theURL and then 
# pass this variable to the read.table() function
# this is an optional extra step, but it 
# makes the code more readable for humans
theURL <- 'https://stats.are-awesome.com/datasets/DMV_2014_Q3_Undergrad_DirectLoans.txt'
loans<-read.table(theURL, header=T, sep=",")
```


## The basic dplyr verbs

###

There are a few basic functions in `dplyr`, which are generally verbs describing the action of the function. 

The first argument to these functions is always the dataframe that you want to manipulate. 

Within these function calls, you can refer to the names of columns in the dataframe WITHOUT quotation marks and WITHOUT the usual `$` syntax. This is cool and makes it easier to type your commands!

Here, we first load the `dplyr` package to get access to these functions, which are not available in R by default (they live in the `dplyr` package). 

Once you load a package, the functions defined in that package are available to you during your current R session, or in subsequent lines of an R script.  

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

**Note:** If you don't want to load ALL the functions in a particular library, you can invoke functions individually by referring to them like this `packageName::functionName`, but most commonly you will load the entire package.  This will only work if you have already installed the package using `install.packages('packageName')`.  In other words, installing a package, and loading it using the `library()` function are separate actions.  You only have to install a function once, but you have to use `library()` in every single R session or R script where you need access to those functions. 

### `filter()` 


The dplyr `filter()` function selects a subset of rows meeting some criterion.  Note that the result is a dataframe. Don't forget to click the "Run Code" button to see the result.  

```{r filter, exercise=TRUE}
filter(loans, School=="GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY")
```

### `filter()` with multiple conditions

You can add multiple filter conditions.  You will get back all the rows for which all the conditions are `TRUE`. For example, the code below gives you all the public universities in DC (i.e.  the universities whose `State` is "DC" and whose `School_Type` is "Public"). Note: only one university meets these criteria.

```{r publicunis, exercise=TRUE}
filter(loans, State=="DC", School_Type=="Public")
```

### Be careful which `filter()` you are using

There is a base R function called `filter()` that does something completely different.  Be careful!  After you load the dplyr package using `library(dplyr)` then you will be using the correct function.  If you ever want to be 1000% sure, you can specify the package directly like this: `dplyr::filter()`. This `::` syntax doesn't load the entire package, it only applies to that single useage of the function.   

### Challenge

Use the `filter()` function to get the data for "AMERICAN UNIVERSITY". 

```{r fAM, exercise=TRUE}
## your code here
```

```{r fAM-solution}
filter(loans, School=="AMERICAN UNIVERSITY")
```

### Double bonus challenge

Use the `filter()` function to get the data for both GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY and GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY in a single line of code. Hint: use the `|` operator instead of the `==` operator to provide multiple matching values.  For example `filter(dataset, val == 1 | val == 2)` would return all rows that match either 1 or 2 in the `val` column. 


```{r mult, exercise=TRUE}
## your answer here
```

```{r mult-solution}
filter(loans, School %in% c("GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY", "GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY"))
```


### `arrange()`

This function is like the "sort" function in MS Excel.  You simply provide a list of column names to sort by, in ascending order. Note, here we are sorting by the total amount of subsidized direct loans each school has. So the first school listed here has the least amount of subsidized direct loans.

```{r}
arrange(loans, State, SubsidizedDL)
```

To sort in descending order instead, we can use the `desc()` function, which is defined by `dplyr`. So now, the first school listed has the greatest amount of subsidized direct loans.

```{r}
arrange(loans, State, desc(SubsidizedDL))
```

### `select()`

This function pulls out just the columns of interest.  You can ask for as many columns as you want to select, separated by commas. Here we are asking for two columns (`State` and `SubsidizedDL`)


```{r}
select(loans, State, SubsidizedDL)
```

### `select()` with `:`

You can select ranges of columns using the `:` operator syntax. (Note: the `:` operator usually only works with numeric data, but this is a special usage defined in the `dplyr` package).

```{r}
select(loans, State:UNSubsidizedDL)
```

### dropping columns with `select()`

You can use the `-` symbol to drop the indicated column rather than to select it.  

```{r}
select(loans, -State, -SubsidizedDL)
```


### `distinct()`

This function extracts the distinct rows. In other words, if two or more rows are identical, then `distinct()` removes the duplicates and returns a single row.  It is most often useful when combined with `select()` to find the unique combinations of some set of rows.

```{r}
distinct(select(loans, State, School_Type))
```

As you can see, there are only 9 rows in the resulting dataframe, which means there are only 9 distinct combinations of `State` and `School_Type` in the `loans` dataframe.

### `mutate()` - getting ready

Mutate will return a dataframe with a new columns added, usually which is created using some combination of the existing columns.  To demonstrate this, first we will create a smaller data frame with just 2 columns. I am just making this smaller dataset because it will be easier to see the new column once we add it, you don't need to select out columns first in your own work. 

```{r}
selectedCols <- select(loans, SubsidizedDL, UNSubsidizedDL)
head(selectedCols)
```

### `mutate()` - adding the column

Now we create a new column called `Total_Loans` which is the sum of the existing colums pertaining to the different loan types. 

```{r}
mutate(selectedCols, Total_Loans = SubsidizedDL + UNSubsidizedDL)
```

### `rowwise()`

Mutate works as expected when you want to manipulate whole columns at once, but sometimes you want to do something on a row-by-row basis.

For example: this code doesn't work as you might expect

```{r}
myDF <- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3), y=c(10, 11, 12))
mutate(myDF, sum=sum(x, y))
```

But the code below computes the sum on a row-by-row basis, as you might expect

```{r}
myDF <- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3), y=c(10, 11, 12))
mutate(rowwise(myDF), sum=sum(x, y))
```


### `summarise()`

Summarizes data into a single row.  This may seem not that useful, but it will become useful when we start grouping data. 

```{r}
summarise(loans, meanSubDL = mean(SubsidizedDL, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Notice that we included an additional argument `na.rm=TRUE`.  This is important, because when you sum up a vector in R, if there are any `NA` values (meaning rows for which you don't have data) then the resulting sum will be `NA`. Usually, we want to ignore those missing values, as we have done here.  

### Challenge

Use the `summarise()` function to create a new column called `minUNSUBDL` that contains the minimum value of the `UNSubsidizedDL` column.

```{r minDL,exercise=TRUE}
## your answer here
```

```{r minDL-solution}
summarise(loans, minUNSUBDL=min(UNSubsidizedDL, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Grouping Data

These functions above get really powerful when you start grouping data based on factors in your dataset.

### `group_by()`

First, we create a new dataframe called `groupedLoans`. If you played around with this dataframe, you would see it is exactly the same as the original, but `dplyr` now knows to do any subsequent operations on the groups defined by the `State` column.


```{r group, exercise=TRUE}
groupedLoans <- group_by(loans, State)
summarise(groupedLoans, meanSubDL = mean(SubsidizedDL, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Now, the same code we used previously to calculate the mean value of `SubsidizedDL` automatically gets applied to each distinct `State` in the dataframe.  

Cool, right? You told it what to do for 1 group, and it has applied your instructions to the three distinct states in the grouped dataframe....good work, computer!

## Chaining operations

`dplyr` also provides a way of chaining together complicated operations with the `%>%` operator.

This prevents having to save intermediate steps, or to have a complicated series of nested functions.

### Which is easier to read?

Both of the below options are equivalent ways of doing a series of operations in R.  Option 1 involves so-called "nested" function calls.  Option 2 uses the %>% operator to chain together operations, which makes for more intuitive code.


**Option 1**

```
leaveHouse(eatBreakfast(getOutOfBed(wakeUp())))
```

**Option 2**

```
wakeUp() %>% getOutOfBed() %>% eatBreafast() %>% leaveHouse()
```

In each step of the chain, the result from everything that has happend so far is passed on to the next function as the first argument. 

Remember: the %>% operator is defined in the `dplyr` libary, so until you run the command `library(dplyr)`, you will get an error if you try to use the `%>%` operator.  

### A real example

Note that the resulting dataframe from each step is passed as the first argument to the next function in the chain. Notice how you can almost follow what is going on just by reading the code out loud:

```{r examp, exercise=TRUE}
meanTotalLoans <- 
  group_by(loans, School_Type, State) %>%
    mutate(Total_Loans = SubsidizedDL + UNSubsidizedDL) %>%
    summarise(mean_total_loans = mean(Total_Loans, na.rm=TRUE))
meanTotalLoans
```

In this example we haven't saved all the intermediate steps, so we don't have leftover dataframes floating around that are missing the State column. In the end, all we have is the `meanTotalLoans` dataframe we saved.



### Chaining works with non-`dplyr()` functions too

Even functions that are not part of `dplyr` or the `tidyverse` can be used with the pipe operator `%>%`. Check out the following...keeping in mind that the `hist()` function is a base R function that doesn't know the pipe `%>%` from a hole in the ground. It still works.

```{r warning=FALSE}

#nested function calls (i.e. the hard-to-read way)

hist(log(rnorm(1000, mean=20, sd=1.4)))

# compare to the chained syntax
rnorm(1000, mean=20, sd=1.4) %>% log %>% hist(main="my nice histogram")


```

## `dplyr` Challenge

There is a dataset called `starwars` that comes with `dplyr`.  Using this dataset, 

  * calculate the mean height and mean mass for the different sexes of each different species of `starwars` character (hint: use `group_by()` and then `summarise()`)
  * you  get extra style points if you use the `%>%` operator to chain your different operations together
  
```{r chall, exercise=TRUE}
## your response here
```

```{r chall-solution}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(sex, species) %>% 
  summarise(meanmass=mean(mass, na.rm=TRUE), meanheight=mean(height, na.rm=TRUE))
```
