## Welcome to ANTH 6413!

<img src="images/intro2course/pyramid.png" height='400' width='auto'>

this is the only pie chart you will see all semester.

## COVID-19 Statement

As your instructor, I recognize that this pandemic has far reaching effects that are felt unevenly for different people based on their personal circumstances including (but not limited to): 

*  exposure to systemic injustice
*  financial situation
*  housing situation
*  childcare responsibilities
*  mental and physical health status
*  health status of family members

My goal is to be as flexible as I can be with each student so that everyone can meet the learning objectives for the course despite the difficulties we face.

## Course Goals


> - Gain the statistical knowledge to critically evaluate the use of statistics in the literature of bioanthro and related fields. 
> - Get hands-on experience implementing analyses with real world data
> - Learn practical tools for doing "data-science"

## All fields are becoming more data intensive

## "Data-science"

**Data science** is an industry buzzword and cliche

From wikipedia:


> "Data science is an interdisciplinary field about <span class="red2">**processes and systems**</span>
> to <span class="red2">**extract knowledge or insights from data**</span>.

> - In private industry, you extract insight from data to make business decisions. 
> - **It is also a big part of what scientists do!**
> - Processes and systems for getting insight from data are important!

## Data science pipeline

## Confession: I believe tools matter, a lot

<img src="images/intro2course/wrench.jpg" height='50%'>

> - We will spend a lot of time on the "how"
> - You will become very familiar with the nuts-and-bolts of analyzing data
> - Most of your grade comes from practical exercises
> - I dont expect you to be a statistician (I sure as hell am not). But I do expect you to learn **how to extract insights from data**

## Grading

Assignment                  | Percent
--------------------------------------------------------|---------------
Weekly homework assignments - submitted on Blackboard  | 40%
Practical Exam 1 | 15%
Practical Exam 2 | 15%
Class Project | 15%
Participation in class and on Flipgrid | 15%

## Zoom {.build}

Classes will be held synchronously on Zoom.  

Classes will be recorded, and the recordings will be available for a limited time only (due to space constraints in storage). 

Recordings are not for download and distribution.

Your primary study materials will be the lecture slides (available on course website) and your notes from class, not the recordings which are temporary.  

## Class ground-rules

These are especially important for breakout-groups, when I am not there all the time. 

1. Be respectful - language matters
2. Don't make assumptions about individuals abilities or experiences
3. Don't dominate the discussion - leave room for others to speak
4. Do keep it lighthearted! This is hard, but learning is fun, y'all!


## Flipgrid - [flipgrid.com/hompalstats](https://flipgrid.com/hompalstats)

<img src="images/intro2course/flipgrid.png" height='300px'>

Weekly responses are part of your participation.  

Respond to my prompt and to AT LEAST 2 classmates.  This is meant to be a conversation ðŸ˜Š


## Google Docs for collaborative notes

[Link to shared Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I6bt77BXsPVJeCnB2Dhtzhlx0ccYF4dS?usp=sharing)

You should all have edit access using your GWU.edu email address.

We will use google documents to keep notes as a group, distribute discussion questions to breakout groups, etc. 

These documents may get pretty wild, but we need a way to communicate text in real time that isn't Zoom chat.  You can use the chat, but remember it's not permanent. 

## Homework {.build}

There are weekly homework assignments in this class.  

These are where you will really learn to do data analysis.  I will walk you through the concepts in class, but you will learn by doing. 

Homework assignments will be uploaded to Blackboard, and are due by the beginning of class on their due date.  

<span class='red2'>**Note**:</span> First homework assignment is due on September 9th. 

I am not a monster and this is a global pandemic, but in order for you to learn, you need to do these in a timely fashion, because concepts build on one another fast!

## Outcome of the course

When you leave this course, I hope you are empowered to:

> -  collect your data in a format that makes your future life easier
> -  explore patterns in your data visually and statistically
> -  test meaningful hypotheses using appropriate statistical tools
> -  communicate these results effectively using graphs and prose


## Tools of the Trade


> - MS Excel
> - Commercial Statistics Packages (e.g., SPSS)
> - R â€“ open source and free package for statistical analysis

## Tools of the Trade


- MS Excel
- ~~Commercial Statistics Packages (e.g., SPSS)~~
- R â€“ open source and free package for statistical analysis

## Why do I use R?

> - **Ignorance** - Because I donâ€™t know how to use anything else
> - **Comprehensiveness** â€“ Learn this one tool well, and you can do (almost) ANYTHING
> - **Reproducibility** â€“ an R script is a detailed record of exactly what I did, from the raw data file, through data transformation, to analysis and results.
> - **Popularity** - R is insanely popular in academia and in industry ("why hello there, marketable skills!")

## What is R?


R is an **open-source** language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 

**open-source** means that anyone can look at the code to see how it works.

## Course Website

https://stats.are-awesome.com

Let's check out the website then we will do the introduction to R

## Intro to R {.build}

We are going to do an interactive tutorial that I wrote. 

In order to not bog down the server, I will split you up into 5 breakout groups of 3-4 people.  I will then come in to the breakout groups and send you a link to the tutorial. 

The links are different, but the tutorials are identical. You will type R code directly into the browser. 

We will spend about 30 - 40 minutes on this, and I will go between the breakout groups.
